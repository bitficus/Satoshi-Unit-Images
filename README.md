# theSat
The "@" changed the way humans communicate digitally, the "sat" will change the way humans transact digitally.


At present, there is not a widely accepted symbol for the Bitcoin unit "Satoshi". This project seeks to establish the "sat" as the currency symbol for the satoshi. 
The sat is in the early drafting stages. The final form of the symbol is still fluid and open to discussion. More than anything, this project puts forth a proposal of the symbol and provides basic infastructure for its adoption.

Ubuntu fonts are freely available for use. These fonts are identical to Ubunutu, except that the "$" has been replaced by the sat ($@).
To use the font download "sat1_ubuntu.otf" > right click the file > install
