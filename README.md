At present, there is not a widely accepted symbol for the Bitcoin unit "Satoshi". This project seeks to establish the "sat" (s@) as the currency symbol for the satoshi. The symbol borrows from the '@', but uses 's' to change "at" to "sat". The sat is in the early drafting stages and it is expected that different fonts and handwriting styles of this symbol will develop. Currently there are 2 variations in the symbol, 1. (s@) and 2. ($@). The final form and function of the symbol is still fluid.  This project puts forth a proposal of the symbol, its theoretical function, and provides basic infastructure for its adoption.

Image files of "the sat" are available in '.Jpg', '.png', and '.svg'. Ubuntu and Times New Roman fonts are freely available for use. These fonts are identical to their namesake, except that "$" has been replaced by the "sat" ($@). All contributions to the project are welcome and encouraged.
